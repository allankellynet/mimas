<h3>To submit to a conference...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>First create your speaker profile in speaker details.
    <li>Then fill in your talk details.
    <li>Finally, list the talks you have, you can then submit the talks you have entered to a conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most likely there is only one conference you can submit to. However, if there is more than one conference
    open for submission you can select it on the submission page.
    The same talk can be submitted to multiple conferences.</p>
<b>Note:</b> Some conference operate a limit on the number of submissions. This limit is shown on the submission page.

<h3>Withdraw and update</h3>
<p>If you need to you can withdraw a submission after submission. Similarly you may update personal and talk details.

<h3>Co-speakers</h3>
When you submit a talk you can specify one or two additional co-speakers if you wish.
These speakers will need to enter their own conference details into this system. Take care to use the same e-mail
address the co-speaker uses in their details entry and on your co-speakers list.
Failure to do so will prevent reviewers from seeing their profile.
