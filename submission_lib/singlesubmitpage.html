<h1>One page submission to {{ crrt_conf.name }}</h1>
<p>If you wish to edit an existing submission, speaker or talk details, or you wish to review feedback,
    then you will need to log into the <a href="/">main Mimas system</a>.</p>
<p>All submissions are indexed using the e-mail address provided so please use the same email address for logging in.</p>
<p>If you are making more than one submission to the same conference you will find it less work to
    login and use the main system where you can save some repeated data entry.
</p>
    <strong>Please note:</strong> Co-speakers should <strong>not</strong> be added on this page.
    <p>Once a submission is made you will have an opportunity to add co-speakers.
