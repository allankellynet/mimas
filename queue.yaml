# Limit default queue to one operation at a time
# Because: assigning reviewers to submissions should not run in parallel
#   if run in parallel the reviewers will get the same submissions
#   on local dev environment this doesn't happen
#   but in cloud multiple tasks do get run together
#
queue:
- name: default
  max_concurrent_requests: 1
  rate: 1/s
