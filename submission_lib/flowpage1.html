<h1>Simple submission to {{ crrt_conf.name }}</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Using this page you can <strong>create a speaker profile</strong>. (If you have used this system before you existing details will be shown.)
    <li>Next you will be asked to give details of your talk.
    <li>Finally you can submit the talk to {{ crrt_conf.name }}.
</ol>
    <p><b>Co-speakers</b>: If your submission has more than one presenter then: one person should make the submission. This person will be the main contact. At the end of the sumission process you can add co-speakers.
    <p>If you are submitting on behalf of someone else then please make a submission and add them as a co-speaker. Make a note in your own "speaker bio" that you are the contact but not the speaker.</p>
    <p>If you wish to <b>edit an existing</b> submission, speaker or talk details, or you wish to review feedback,
    then you will need to log into the <a href="/">main Mimas system</a>.</p>
<p>All submissions are indexed using the e-mail address provided so please use the same email address for logging in.</p>
<p>If you are making more than one submission to the same conference you will find it less work to
    login and use the main system where you can save some repeated data entry.

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">

        (<a href="/speakerdir" target="_blank">View speaker directory in new window</a>)
